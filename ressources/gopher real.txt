appealing I think." -- Rob Sayers

​** Points to ponder:
 
[We] like to consider the hundreds of interconnected
Gopher servers to be one large distributed entity; thus,
we speak of "the Gopher", with its many small parts,
spread throughout the Internet. The Gopher is always
growing, always changing. It's everywhere, but you can't
locate it; it's always there, but you can't see it. ...
The Gopher is the largest and most practical example of
applied pantheism in the history of mankind.
